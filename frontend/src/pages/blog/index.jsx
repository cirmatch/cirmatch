      <h1>♻️ Bangladesh’s Plastic Waste Crisis: Can a Digital Marketplace Fix the Supply Chain?</h1>

      <p>
        Bangladesh is growing — rapidly. But with economic growth, urbanization, and industrial development comes a dark side: plastic pollution. Despite having a robust network of recyclers and waste collectors, Bangladesh’s plastic waste management sector is informal, fragmented, and inefficient.
      </p>

      <p>
        So how do we turn this crisis into an opportunity? Let’s dive into the numbers, the challenges, and how digital technology — including platforms like <a href="https://cirmatch.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="underline font-semibold">Cirmatch.com</a> — can reshape the entire supply chain.
      </p>

      <h2>📊 The Scale of the Plastic Waste Problem in Bangladesh</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Bangladesh generates over 800,000 tons of plastic waste annually.</li>
        <li>In Dhaka city alone, more than 646 tons of plastic waste is produced every single day.</li>
        <li>Only 36% of total plastic waste is recycled — and most of that is done informally.</li>
        <li>Around 70% of plastic waste in Bangladesh is mismanaged, ending up in landfills, drains, or rivers.</li>
        <li>The problem is worsening: per capita plastic consumption rose from 3 kg in 2005 to 9 kg in 2020, especially in urban areas.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>🛠️ Why the Recycling Supply Chain is Broken</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Highly Informal & Unregulated</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>About 90% of plastic recycling is by informal players.</li>
            <li>Most waste pickers operate without licenses or registration.</li>
            <li>No proper pricing, quality control, or documentation exists.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Inefficient Communication</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Trade happens mostly by phone calls, brokers, or in-person visits.</li>
            <li>No centralized platform to know who’s selling or buying what, and where.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Lack of Trust & Transparency</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Buyers struggle to verify quality and quantity.</li>
            <li>Sellers often face delayed payments or unreliable buyers.</li>
            <li>No rating, review, or tracking system; everything depends on informal connections.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Logistics Chaos</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>No organized transportation system exists.</li>
            <li>Materials are moved inefficiently, increasing cost and carbon footprint.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>💡 The Missed Potential: Circular Economy in Action</h2>
      <p>
        Proper management could unlock huge value from waste:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Recycled plastic replacing virgin plastic in manufacturing at lower cost.</li>
        <li>Creating hundreds of thousands of formal jobs in the supply chain.</li>
        <li>Reducing environmental damage and gaining recognition for sustainability.</li>
      </ul>
